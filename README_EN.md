### Used Software Development Methodology: Incremental Development

Incremental Software Development methodology is an agile software development approach that enables the development process to be repeated in small steps, allowing for a better understanding of the process and customer requirements.
In this methodology, the development process involves a series of iterations or increments. Each increment is designed to complete a goal based on customer requirements. The development process ends with the completion, testing, and acceptance of an increment. The customer provides feedback by reviewing the product after each increment. This feedback is used to develop subsequent increments.
